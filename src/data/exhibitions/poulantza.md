In her new exhibition Natassa Poulantza explores the quality and the values of the digital version of a former module of paintings under the topic “Flower Portraits”. It is about new works of art in which the mighty idea coexists with high quality technical accomplishment and their photographical imprinting. At the same time they spark studies on the technical reproducibility of the work of art providing a complete suggestion and testimony, a uniform visual environment rich and full of content that is open to multiple interpretations and approaches. Natassa Poulantza’s flowers constitute unexpected portraits in close correspondence to human behaviours, spiritual and emotional situations, manifestations and experiences. Through the photorealistic attribution and beyond their indisputable aesthetic completeness and beauty, they surpass what is obvious, revealing an internal and substantial way of experiencing the reality and they refer to life, love and death, the crucial and existential questions of life.

In a parallel manner, the compositions of the flowers and the ants reveal the allure of a whole peculiar microcosm, while brand new digital compositions of flowers, again, supplement the exhibition. They demonstrate and attest the structured experimentation and the evolution of the artist’s pursuits through a procedure of a constant ripening of her glance, the topics and broader spiritual and aesthetic enquiries, transgressions and redefinition of her art.

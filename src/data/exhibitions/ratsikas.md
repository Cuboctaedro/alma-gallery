In Dimitris Ratsikas’ works the subject is charged with the emphatic meaning it is attributed by and the way it is processed.
His painting remains deeply man-centered; the core of his work is the man and his world and this subject is approached through versions and suggestions that are rich and concise in meaning.

His creation in correspondence with emotional and spiritual situations, transcribes reality emphasizing on the study and sharp observation, the aesthetic experience and the procedure of the act of painting and completion of the work, the visual stimulations and their resonance, the sheer visual values, the expressiveness and directness, the plasticity and expressiveness of the colour, the carefully analysed and calculated ratio of the space, of the rhythm and balance, making the experiences, thoughts and worldview visible.

His compositions are mainly frontal and are imposed with their drawing sharpness, solid organization, free, juicy and flowing brush, the might and intensity of gestural writing, the big forms and deformities, the monumental feeling. On the verge of explicit and allusive wordings from a rational point of view, emotional function and subjective view and attribution, he visualizes his vital relationship with the world and life, he communicates, conceives in a persuading way the status of the figure, the routes and its adventure, raising existential issues, touching at the same time, in a unique way the boundaries of representation through the constant maturity of the gaze, the experimentation, technical completeness, the consistency and coherence of his sentences, the broadness of his philosophical views and concerns.

The ALMA gallery presents the visual artist Dimitris Kokoris, in his first solo exhibition, entitled Cascade. From October 20 to November 26, 2022, people interact with artworks that narrate the weird sense of the artists’ mellow experiences. Hybrid environments depicting natural landscapes being urbanized and correspondingly urbanized that are being disembodied, human figures being devastated by too much information - a vigorous commentary of our times, phallic and religious symbols - screams of social stereotypes, animals and mythical creatures in the form of cartoons, imprints of a distorted childhood, pestilence of the modern age.

The weird sense of the mellow experiences is the key element in the pictorial narrative that the visual artist, Dimitris Kokoris, presents in his first solo exhibition. Hybrid environments depicting natural landscapes being urbanized and correspondingly urbanized being disembodied, human figures being devastated by too much information - a vigorous commentary of our times, phallic and religious symbols - screams of social stereotypes, animals and mythical creatures in the form of cartoons, imprints of a distorted childhood, pestilence of the modern age. Dimitris is moved by memory. Using his fine nib, acrylic and oil colors, the artist draws without control, creating a huge multi-thematic ensemble that at first glance seems like an avalanche of images. A closer approach of each drawing separately is coming to surprise the spectator. There is no reference or preliminary sketch, the ink is poured directly onto the paper indicating the determination, confidence and ingenuity of the painter. Kokoris remains honest in the geometrical consciousness. His endless grids are always held together by underground linear and horizontal axes that create polyphonic ensembles not limited to the four corners of each painting, avoiding to impose on the viewer the end of the composition. Each work is a unique space dome that tries to communicate its space to the perceptual experience of the viewer . 1 Influenced by ethnological elements of other cultures, where the image is included directly in the communication code, continuously juggling between Western and Eastern ways of thinking, he endeavors to define his thoughts and articulate his desires figuratively. The artist does not paint in order to express himself. His foremost intention is to control the fear of loss, to relieve the material needs that have been instilled deep in society, to finally create a cascade of what he sees, thinks, observes, feels. In a way he collects his personal assets, which he uses to achieve the supreme need of human beings.

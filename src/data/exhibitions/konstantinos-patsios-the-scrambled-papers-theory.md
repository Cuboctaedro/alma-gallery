Konstantinos Patsios calls his new work “The Scrambled Papers Theory”. If the unconscious is structured as a language, the juxtaposition of his “Scrambled Papers” structres a new communication code. The double meaning of the title is also a word game, an idirect reference ot the Egg, as the conflation of the material in art with the flavour, and as the archetype of creation and birth. “ My artistic work has to do with the creation of another body” the artist says. “There is a psychonalytical dimension and an obsession with the automatic writing in the whole of my work. My work has to do with the random. Every little paper fragment of the city walls and every fragments of moments in my own life are transformed into a surealism that draws its force from the unconscious, adopts its unruly and free structure, expresses desires and fears through the language of the symbols and emerges through the logic of the dream, where everything is possible.

Louiza Karapidakis, the art historian, writes about the exhibition: “Konstantinos Patsios presents the latest unit of his works, mainly collages with combined techniques and overpaintings. This time he chooses large canvases. Thus, he has the opportunity to make good use of his morphoplastic values, skillfully combining ready pictures with his own interventions and compositions. He insistently uses recognizable motifs from classic works of the history of art, giving them new descriptive value through his additions and fusions. People, landscapes and symbols, recognizable or insinuated ones, are enriched with his painted interventions and make historical references, invent commentations or create symbolic allegories. There are also plenty of autobiographic elements he gives, even using personal objects as points of reference and journal. The expression he uses himself to characterize his work is “submersion to the unconscious” because he systematically repeats the black element as an expression of the unconscious, the dream, the total void, the end, the death. It is also a tribute to the German romantic artists of the 18th century, sho brought to light unconscious phenomena, such as repressed emotions, automatic skills, hidden fears and desires. Patsios, with his recognizable writing, continually shapes new, timeless realities turning them into impressive visual formulations with multi-dimensional content”.

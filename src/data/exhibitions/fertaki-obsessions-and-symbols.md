A tour in the outstanding visual language of Vana Fertaki is attempted through the exhibition “Obsessions and Symbols”. The works that are full of vital energy and impulsive brushes constitute a dictionary filled with pictures of a chaotic world. The colour, being an adventurous wandering to unknown places, is prevalent.

According to Eleni Gatsa, art historian “…We find ourselves in the centre of a panicky world where the creator sketches a lively world with pulse and energy using not only the frenzy of the colors but also a storm of symbols and points. With her paintings Vana Fertakis answers with spontaneous humour to the current affairs and is looking for the version of her existence by interpreting her symbols. It is a spontaneous drawing which becomes a question of spiritual depth sometimes with disarming innocence and others with tremendous seriousness…”

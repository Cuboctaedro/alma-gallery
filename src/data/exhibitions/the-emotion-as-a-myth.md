The team of four contemporary artists, Sylvia Antoniadis, Vaggelis Theodoridis, Giorgos Kavounis and Vivi Papadimitriou, can turn the spirit to matter and the matter to spirit within a “pagan mysticism”.

This mysticism has nothing to do with the worship of a transcendental deity, but it seems to deify the soul and body. It is the “earthen” incarnation of the symbols and the “mythologisation” of the emotions, the adventure of the soul and the human instincts. Archetypes, often with references to literature or the opera, gather on the surfaces of a canvas, on carvings, drawings, water-colours or on works on wood, insisting on every last detail.

The artists, each one in their own special way, subvert the conditional picture or things, turning experiences to a life philosophy.

Vaggelis Theodoridis’s myth is about a future middle-age when, after a series of world wars, the Nature has made the necessary adjustments and mutations.

Sylvia Antoniadis, in her four-fold work under the title “Synthesis of Desire”, describes aspects of the human passion, referring to works of Verdi, Strauss and Balzac.

Giorgos Kavounis’s myth has to do with his own Lucifer. The fallen angel takes shape through the “creator’s” eye, who looks at him from above.

Vivi Papadimitriou talks to the viewer about how it is to lose yourself and find it again by imposing who you are.

![Vivi Papadimitriou, <br>Be Bee](/exhibitions/the-emotion-as-a-myth/vivi-papadimitriou-be-bee_862x960.jpg)

All four artists reveal their personal vision, always in a specific directorial viewpoint regarding the setup of the synthesis, and in this way they give birth to and impose their own style by simply being themselves.

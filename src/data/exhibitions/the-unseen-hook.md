The title of the exhibition The unseen hook derives from Evelyn Waugh’s book, Brideshead Revisited – The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder. The “unseen hook” is what binds us to the past, to the experiences and memories, the emotions, the secrets and the unfulfilled expectations, everything that defined and formulated us, everything that we loved and betrayed, that we hurt and got hurt by.

Andreas Vousouras creates a body of pictorial references which he incorporates, elaborates, combines and transforms into works of art that are imaginative and original, as well as unconventional and subversive regarding both the plastic art and the meaning. He depicts his vital relationship with life and modern reality in a systematic way, which shows a non-negotiable attitude and a crucial concern. He focuses on the stereotypes, the roles and the symbols, the contradictions, the schisms and the malfunctions of the being and the human condition in compositions where the personal experience co exists with the socio-political dimension, the sensitivity with the cruelty, the irony with the deconstructive humour, the intimate with the obvious. He achieves that, not descriptively, but in a constructive and internal way, through the visual realization of his compositions and the turn towards the deeper essence of things.

Alexandros Maganiotis’ compositions constitute narrations on the borderline between “normal”, “paradox” and “ambiguous”. The design clarity, the bright, almost transparent colours, the connection between word and picture, as well as the literary references (from Octavio Paz to Paul Celan and Georgios Seferis), the surreal spirit and the pop aesthetics, the unpredictable meetings and combinations, the game of the logical consequences and the interchanges, of the transformations and disguises, the projection of intimate fears, fantasies and dreams, they all activate a different condition, they introduce an alternative, extremely interesting conception of the world. The pictures include the memory and the experience, broaden the vision, challenge and capture the look, constitute a mental mechanism, an “abc” book of human life itself and its adventure.

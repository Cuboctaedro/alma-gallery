Αrtists ιn their effort to be inspired they are led to acts of painting that lead to something new. These works are Meteora works which most often lead to a change in style and in their way of painting.

It is moments of inspiration and truth as well as the evolution of the painting. In his studio the artist creates works that are often revealed as purely themselves. These novelty moves and acts create something new even though the whole process has not changed in anything. Works that eventually escape into a parallel space. Unexpectedly, suddenly as if they haven't any roots in the past.

Meteora works with unknown consequences. A secret transformation experience as the nymph transforms into a butterfly. It is the internal needs of the work that are done by the artist at an unspecified time and with the work and only the work as a guide. These artists do not create concept but values.

These moments and paintings mark the change in a mature way the artist understands the work he completes. In the already painted values that the artist uses and the spectator understands, new undefined results added - is what we call new. When you live, you truly draw. Painting changes with life. Why do people paint?

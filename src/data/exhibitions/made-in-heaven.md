The pink fantasy world of Stamatis Theocharis draws inspiration by the culture of saltibags found in P. Picasso's pink period, the pop aesthetics of J. Rosenquist, and the surrealistic recording of R. Magritte's form.

With a careful observation boxed narratives become apparent. The frame lives inside the frame, behind decorative and kaleidoscopic symbols. Synthesis reminiscing Renaissance and models with voyeuristic poses transport us to the birth of gender liberation.

The often use of gold colour transports us to a parallel post-Byzantine timeless place. In this way Stamatis personifies the concept of gender fluidity and translates it into universality. It turns it into a cult image, indelible in time.

Pink appears in a paradoxical way breaking the typical pretexts and at the same time clearly refers  to the colour of flesh and genitals.
His brushes are structured and strict, almost with typographic precision.

The central theme becomes the modern iconography of the Holy Table, transporting us to a divine celestial landscape. The man-woman dipole is integrated into a one and only existence. This contrast introduces us to issues of identity and internal observation.

When the main subject becomes oval, it resembles the pregnancy of a potentially hatching self.
Are we born or become?
The question of our philosophical pursuits is eternal.

The artist responds with the inner judge of himself and raises issues of fetish and bipolarity.

The strange, as one might say, the QUEER, the LGBD community, the BDSM, the woman with the beard that radiates prestige or the female pirate, the disguises, the angels, the union of two heads, the shackles through ropes and knots, flowers and Greek traditional tablecloth, pipes and cityscape, Japanese references, graffiti, comics, kinky clothes, animals such as butterflies and snakes, pigs and flies, become a game of redemption and liberation from the shackles of social projects.

![Fluid reality, <br>acrylic on canvas, <br>100 x 80 cm](/exhibitions/made-in-heaven/09.jpg)

Stamatis's hand becomes the printing machine of a dreamy associative world that reacts to anything established. It redefines the viewer's gaze and captures as a photo reporter, a Queer bubble gum manifesto, with invisible pieces of a hidden, sensitive, cunning and free from prejudice, love life.

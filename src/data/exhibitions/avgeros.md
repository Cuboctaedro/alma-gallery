Yiorgos Avgeros’s preference to depict nature the last few years is taken for granted. Black and white landscapes, trees and meadows, forests and branches of trees – images full of light and dampness – prove his obsession with the anarchic natural landscape, which expresses his temporary – I guess – opposition to the structured urban territory. In his recent visual module he mainly deals with the forest. He gets inspired by his mysterious and evocative pieces which give him the opportunity to play with the shadows, reclaims perspective to the maximum giving his paintings a unique sense of depth and volume, outstanding plasticity with intense tonal harmonies and contrasts. The human figure that timidly appeared in some of his previous works of art, appears again integrated in the ensemble bus always smaller in relation to the prevalence and magnificence of the theme.

Throughout the evolution of his work Avgeros gradually evades from the strict black and white landscape, adds colour, lights and blows breath of life to the images of the forest. At the same time a tiny refugee replaces Alice – the myth is substituted by the violent reality- a hunter is barely seen deep down an opening. However the birds and animals of the forest come to the foreground. A vulture, a dog, a hare and some birds disrupt the silence of the forest and look like they want to prevail on it. Some of the paintings look like small, almost instant narrations on a 3D background.

In order to consummate his works of art, Yiorgos Avgeros has devised his own unique technique. He paints with charcoal and color on different levels of transparent film in order to give to the viewer the third dimension and relief sculpturing. In some of his latest paintings we could say that his technique reaches its peak. As the tree trunks appear on the foreground, every detail of the wood and every spot that lies on his surface are obvious, while the colour imprints both the age and the texture of it.

The artist creates, in his own unique way, a series of realistic paintings which, nevertheless, are not compatible with the terms of realism or naturalism as they are written down by the Art History. The mix of painting with modern sculpture-featured elements in many stages of his work – make his works of art significant in terms of conception, construction and originality.

Yiorgos Avgeros is a young, imaginative, thinking and modest artist or could even be characterized as a laborer. The mixing of arts and techniques is nothing more than reminisces of the past being brought to recent days with the aid of modern means and materials in a sentimental, creative and multilayered visual game.

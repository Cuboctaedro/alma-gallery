Alma Gallery completes 8 years of successful and consistent presence in the field of visual arts and celebrates the “anniversary” with an original exhibition. Two or our first associates, Pavlos Samios and Manolis Charos, are called to retrace these 8 years with 16 of their works. Each presents 8 compositions in chronological order, to represent the 8 years of the gallery.

The trained look, the sharpness in design, the intense plasticity, the rich colour range, the essential simplification, the perspective deformations and the isproportions in the scales of the figures and objects, the multiple references ranging from the byzantine hagiography to the modern conquests, they all contribute to Pavlos Samios’ art. His compositions tell stories on the margin between dream and reality, like a monument in a timeless present. His subjects take the emphatic importance he gives to them and with the impeccable technique he uses when dealing with them, he succeeds in speaking clearly, and at the same time suggestively, through what is commonly seen, about what he feels beyond this.

The co-existence of incongruous patterns, the anti-realistic disposition, the unusual viewpoints, the unorthodox conflicts in size, the design qualities, the brightness, the richness and the sensuality of the hues, they are all primary elements in Manolis Charos’ art. His style emerges sensitive, elliptical and symbolic, drawing the routes in a dreamlike and deeply romantic world, offering emotion and visual delight, creating immediate, vivid and spontaneous impressions. His compositions visualize stimuli and memories, they reshape the natural space with pure painting values, they imposethemselves with their fragmentation and their aesthetics, thus suggesting a different, poetic and metaphysical version of what is visible.

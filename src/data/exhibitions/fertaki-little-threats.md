I first met Vana Fertaki a few years ago, on the occasion of a show I was curating, and we have collaborated a couple of times ever since.Each time she invites me to present her work, I know I will be surprised... and that's because she works colors and design, composition, surfaces and sizes with tremendous intensity. More precisely, she works obsessively and meticulously in a street artist's way, the canvas being her wall.

The element of her artistic style which first attracted me, and still does, is that it keeps being a mixture of rage, love and hatred, hope and pessimism, seeming a voluptuous, insatiable endless journey...

Colors, forms, meanings, senses, desires, being diffused on the canvas, emerge through conscious mental composition by which the artist places her shapes in an almost worshipping way, mixing free hand drawing with strict geometry, white and black with all other colors.

Deeply preoccupied by composition and color, she works methodically and systematically on seemingly flat colored surfaces creating, in the end, through tremendous dexterity, her own personal space, including an array of games, connections and perspectives.

Perspectives leading to a depth of field so intense and successful, just like in photography, simultaneously creating the sensation of 3D effect, where circles and broken lines form an absolutely personal universe, where religious and metaphysical symbols and concerns, assisted by pop art colors and the artist's personal sense of humour, but also the way she handles them, she repositions and redifines them, composing her own cartoon planet.

That is where they are dematerialized, purified, they become contemporary and are being transformed through personal mythology to collective symbology.

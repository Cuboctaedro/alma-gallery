With the gradual lift of lockdown measures and the much anticipated reopening of galleries and art spaces, ALMA gallery is happy to present the group exhibition On a Small Scale: A Mosaic of Contemporary Creation, which consists entirely of small works. The gallery's curatorial team has invited 39 contemporary artists, local and international, long-time and newer collaborators, who will transform its space into a mosaic of contemporary creation. ALMA hopes the exhibition will generate an inspired discussion about artistic creation during a pandemic, while using the small scale as a focus. A small artwork embraces the viewer differently to an imposing large-scale work. With more than 50 small works, including photography, painting, drawing, sculpture, construction and mixed media, the exhibition invites viewers to approach and consider if and how scale ultimately shapes the way we experience art.

Maria Giannakaki focuses on the urban scenery of Athens and attributes accurately the figural peculiarities of the city. The drawing imprint of the panoramic view of the city is particularly visually interesting with detailed insinuating references and its descriptiveness in combination with the selected pictorial subtraction. The expressive power of the city’s relief is surrounded by a peculiar atmosphere between the dreamy and the idyllic.

Alekos Kiraninis uses the art of frottage and collage with the art of drawing giving a flat-relief texture to his works and selective expressiveness to certain points. In his visual repertoire, despite the stilted figural austerity and the dim tonality of his works, a wealth of cultural loans from the scholar religious and Greek folk art is obvious. At the same time, an opulent conceptual speculation is also obvious in his iconographic references with central keystone the juxtaposition of the powers of good and evil.

Tassos Mantzavinos with his symbolic and sometimes metaphorical compositions illustrates fragmentary accumulated timeless memories. In his drawings mythological episodes are imprinted, historical memorandums are included, more recent immaterial traditions, without clear-cut boundaries are described and, last but not least, personal experiences are mentioned. The drawing gesture of his art turns into a graphic representation, acquires material essence and intensity, thus transmitting the emotional tension of the artist.

Vasilis Papanikolaou using pencil on paper captures landscapes of the countryside through a typical angle that reminds us of Japanese stamp. The perception of the landscape that is without restricting rules and the iconographic attribution of it constitute the main difference of his drawing result, which creates a game between the foreground and the background, the material and the non-material.

Kalliroi Marouda depicts with her drawing the view of a park with only living element that of a dog. Her works refer to a real landscape but their attribution, despite the representational realistic data, is mainly characterized by the intensely minimalistic aesthetics of the empty space. Her narrative landscapes, despite their stringent style, emit a poetic expressiveness.

Mantalina Psoma following her well recognized painting style, transfers into her drawings the atmosphere of ‘the silent moment’ through internal illusory landscapes. In her compositions the absence of colour and the dynamics of her drawing reinforce the loneliness of the scenery, with or without the prevalent human presence riveting the viewer at the sight of the painting narration of a real but at the same time imaginary world.

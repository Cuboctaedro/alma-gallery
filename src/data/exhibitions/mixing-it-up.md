Stamatis Theocharis, Michalis Kiousis, Dimitris Kokoris, Konstantinos Patsios and Vana Fertakis, are among its youngest collaborators, with a presence abroad through their participation in art fairs with Alma. They take advantage of the unique characteristics of their visual medium to create artworks that approach painting as a platform for thought and unexpected conversations. With works that oscillate between observation and invention, depiction and allegory, they treat the canvas as an assemblage space where references converge conceptually in a highly adventurous way.

Stamatis Theoharis, pink pop, surrealistic, contrasting universe comments on various social stereotypes while expressing existential anxieties. The painting gesture of Michalis Kiousis is distinguished by the emphasis on color and light, capturing scenes of everyday life interspersed with cultural pursuits. With works he created during his stay in Indonesia in 2019, Dimitris Kokoris highlights the specific ethnological element that influenced him pictorially and researchally. By combining collage and painting, Konstantinos Patsios intertwines the pictorial tradition with the pop element, capturing play in visual terms.

Milios’ painting which initially referred and extended to surrealism finds itself in the sphere of abstraction with many of his compositions being characterized by the expressionistic power of the colour and the plasticity of the design. Figurative motifs – schematic figures of humans and animals, scenery fragments- coexist with graphisms, imprints, traces of script, irregular or geometrical shapes,emerge or submerge into the abstract surfaces of colour that flows or spreads in the form of spills and spots with quick brushes. His shapes are freely arranged, juxtapose, overlap or penetrate each other creating an open field of transformations and reshapes, release energy, intensify the impression of instinctive gesture, automatic recording, impulsive burst. With chromatic austerity and purity, detailed design and a “primitive” conception, he evokes images of an unknown world, that refer to rock paintings and ideographs, the Chinese calligraphy and the spontaneity of children’s paintings. He presents small, unexpected narrations with weird biomorphic formations, creating a dreamy- poetic ambience.

Drawing has always been a chapter of great significance for the artist, as well as a broad scope of experimentation that frames his art and can be used as a code of understanding and an analytical comment to a better and more thorough approach and interpretation of his art.

A big number of his most recent perforative drawings is presented in Athens, in the “Alma Gallery”. The exhibition is about drawings of exceptional accuracy, aesthetics and dexterity, almost minimalistic that stand out for the originality of technique without the use of pencil or coal, the sheer simplicity, the intensity of discontinuous lines and also the emphasis on the essence while being developed in a self sufficient and defective way on the white surface of the canvas and is sometimes stressed chromatically. The same spirit is prevalent in his painting compositions accordingly. They are big, monochromatic, surfaces on which shapes are mainly formed with small spots leading to a unique level of maturity, simplicity, sensitivity and expressiveness.

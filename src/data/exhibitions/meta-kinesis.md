With its physical spaces temporarily closed due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, ALMA gallery is delighted to present its first exclusively online exhibition, ‘Meta-Kinesis’. 

Presenting a curated selection of works by a multigenerational group of contemporary artists working in a variety of mediums, from abstract and figurative painting to sculpture, drawing and photography, the exhibition is built upon a twofold axis. On the one hand, it explores isolation, a familiar state for many of us during this time, while on the other hand it examines movement in a world that currently seems stagnant. 

Self-isolation, which to many of us experiencing it at the moment seems strange and unusual, has always been essential to artistic creation, which by nature is a solitary occupation. An artist’s studio is an almost spiritual space, dedicated to experimentation, imagination and perpetual creation. Movement reigns within its walls, and will continue to do so even after the end of this global health crisis. Therefore, isolation and motion coexist harmoniously in Art. With ‘Meta-Kinesis’, the viewer is invited to a unique viewing of contemporary artistic creation that captures and redefines isolation, while at the same time foreshadows the intense and exciting mobility that is to follow.

ALMA Gallery happily presents for a seconf time an exhibition of the two eminent and active professors of Athens School. Michalis Manousakis and Angelos Antonopoulos surprise us with a memorial, anachronistic exhibition.
 
**ALMOST IN PARALLEL II - the continuation of their common path eleven years later, from students to teachers until now.**

Traveling to a fantasy timeless place full of references, we found ourselves in between, Rene Magritte’s surrealism, the linear abstraction of 20th century painting and minimalism. Michalis Manousakis, with the heritage of the post-avant-garde, transports us to a modern Greek narrative.

With the conceptual depiction of a burned sunset, his half-illuminated timeless landscapes, become a magical twilight, that a man, helpless in the vortex of the full moon, submits to his primordial nature.

Something from the exit of Adam and Eve in the garden of Paradise, as captured by the proto-renaissance of Masaccio and the aesthetics of a peeking look through a keyhole or an imaginary camera Obscura, takes us to a voyeuristic wooden dream-sphere.

Michalis Manousakis is an erotic storyteller with timeless qualities, while almost in parallel Angelos Antonopoulos is an alien radiologist of the biology of the soul and mind.

Influenced by New-dadaism and a slightly something from Duchamp’s big glass, A. Antonopoulos creates an eternal portrait of self-identification. An asexual self but omnipresent. A heartbroken soul, full of dust and that life is reborn, like a bug or a parasite through the ashes of another life. In an environment reminiscent of a museum of biological history, he creates fast science fiction narratives, comprising the history of the world and talks about what is to come. Ideas for the future.
A memorial of joy and evolution of the posthumous activity of the soul, which leaves everyday life and seeks the Ideal Truth. That Idea of the only absolute truth that Platoon contemplated.

When within a decade their paths proceed in parallel, dream and association become starting points of expression.

Two people ending in symbols. Modern ideograms. MM and AA become the "MA"(pun which means but in Greek) of a gaze that flickers in time, of a silence that a nocturne landscape emerges.

In “MA”’s aesthetics
They are transforming into a new linear b, the red thread of Klotho, Lachesis and Atropos in the ancient Greek myth of Fate, in an alienated alphabet-primer of emotional intelligence, in a mystical atmosphere where the mind, through identification, ends up in its primary needs. Nature.

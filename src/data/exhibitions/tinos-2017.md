The artists participating in the exhibition entitled *In Narrative Tense* are called upon to take over the role of visual creators in order to discover and define from the scratch the substantial function of art. Through that role, the artists are pointing out a dignified and conscious standing point for man who at a critical moment in human history is marooned in an impetuous breakdown, in complete rupture with values, origins and identity sources, in a world fragmentary and rapidly transforming, a disorientated world which has lost its constants and its exacerbating impasses. Art, once more, aspires to become extrovert and communicative, to state its own answers, to articulate its own word on a series of crucial questions and issues.

The artists narrate a story. A story of personal and collective experiences, a story that sets worldviews and philosophical concepts, a story that handles contemporary concerns such as nature and sense of justice. In total, the artworks pursue to convey the active-critical stance of their creators, a cohesive proposal, a mental construction, a visual intervention, and to perform both as language, action and idiom, word, expression and image –the artistic “dialogue” in an era of intense and
dramatic upheavals.

Art is of course in no position to offer immediate solutions; but art remains a powerful means of communication that is still championing principles of participation and collectivity, still inspired –transcending the boundaries and stereotypes of theory– by a desire to present clearly the fundamentals of human thought and behaviour, inspiring people to think critically and seek self-expression; it stirs up feelings of elation and humanism, it encourages renewal and the overthrow of the status quo, it envisions new utopias, it embraces and tables novel ideas and ways of life that do not conform with the dominant socio-political reality.
The exhibition is realized under the auspices of the *Tinos Festival 2017* and it will take place at venues in [*Chora*](#chora), [*Exomvourgo*](#exomvourgo) and [*Pyrgos*](#pyrgos).

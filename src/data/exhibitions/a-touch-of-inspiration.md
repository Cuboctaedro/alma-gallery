It is with great joy that ALMA gallery is presenting an exhibition in memory of Pavlos Samios in Tinos this summer.

"At this time last year, in the historic neighbourhood of Triantaros in Tinos, ALMA gallery, in collaboration with the owners of the holiday home "A Touch of New - Aspalathos" were organising an exhibition of the work of our beloved Pavlos Samios.

Due to the pandemic, the exhibition, which Pavlos was really looking forward to, was sadly canceled.

Sadly, this year, this wonderful artist is no longer with us. Together with my dear friend Maria Almpani, we have decided to organise this exhibition in his memory, showcasing characteristic works from different periods of his career.

Hence, this summer, we wish to welcome you to this distinguished setting where you will have the opportunity to admire Pavlos' art.

Maria Almpani was Pavlos' dear friend, and this is why it is easy for me to accept this generous invitation.

The presence of Pavlos Samios in the art world will never cease to exist. Together with Pavlos' friends and close collaborators, it is my honour to be able to cherish his work as faithfully as I can.

I thank you all and look forward to welcoming you."

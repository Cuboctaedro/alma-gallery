Martin Donef with exceptional drawing qualities and a unique sense of painting style, creates a space in which the subtraction, symmetry, strict geometric structure create a new dynamic convention. The tonal gradations of the grey, white and black colour, the lights and shadows, the sense of motion and rhythm, the multiplication and expansion, the illusion of depth, the plasticity and coating of shapes, the nettings of lines, the reflections and mirrorings introduce us to a world where the symbolic references to the modern chaotic and complex reality coexist with metaphysical concerns and existential issues as well as concepts like communication and transition. Martin Donef composes images with intensity and expressive power, with precision and clarity, kaleidoscopic images that emerge and recede transubstantiating his experiences, highlighting and projecting the experiential character in direct correspondence and relation to spiritual and emotional situations and behaviours.

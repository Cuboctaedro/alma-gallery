A kaleidoscope of personal narratives and performances, compose the artworks of Leonidas Giannakopoulos, Alexandros Maganiotis, Constantinos Patsios and Dimitris Skourogiannis, presented on Friday, October 30, 2014 at the group exhibition hosted by ALMA gallery in Trikala. The exhibition will last until November 27, 2015.  
 
The artists with their works “travel” the viewer from experience to memory, from the past to the present and the future, and from the real world to the world of the possible and the transcendental.

Leonidas Giannakopoulos with his special technique, invents forms located at an unspecified time that balance between familiar and new, mix the logical with the illogical, creating eventually a utopian environment. The details of his artworks are impressive. It is a meticulous work with characteristic image clarity, where the perception of reality intersects with symbols, concepts and characters of the collective memory, creating dreamlike worlds.

With an association of image and speech in Alexander Maganiotis’ artworks, each letter is a symbol that when acquires its own image with anthropomorphic characters through the humorous – cynical look of the author, forms words. The viewer with this imaginative and original technique, penetrates into the dreamlike narratives of each artwork and is then left to his own connotations.

The spontaneous compositions of Konstantinos Patsios have diverse implications and symbolisms, which the artist expands and enriches with contemporary existential, political and historical problems. The works reflect the anguish of the modern world, become pictorial views – confessions of experiences and emotional states, living their own secret life through the cross-connect seemingly mismatched images and impressions, constituting a harmonious artistic proposal.

The visual style of Dimitris Skourogiannis, is pervaded by intense lyricism and deep knowledge and understanding of his current themes. His works have an initial substrate, then with original materials and techniques evolve from level to level, new items are added, resulting in an overall symbolism, beyond their initial report. Issues such as the search for identity, adulthood, through the “multi-read” of his artworks, are transformed gaining a deeper reflection.  

The four artists sometimes allegorical, sometimes implicitly, are interlaced with images of reality and fantasy that lead one step beyond realism, dream and escape from the ordinary. At an era that one needs different thinking and different aesthetic, the viewer of the exhibition is entitled according to his personal look to identify, collate and finally to understand the symbolisms.

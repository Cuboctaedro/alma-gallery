*Plain* as is soil and blood.
*Plain* as is sacrifice and katharsis.
*Plain* as is Folk Song.
*Plain* as is Revolution and submission.
*Plain* as is freedom and wide horizons.
*Plain* as Yesterday. Plain as Today.
Pl*ain as is Thessalian Plain.

Nearing the close of 2021, ALMA gallery proudly presents the group exhibition Of the Plain with the participation of 13 renowned Greek artists. The narrative Of the Plain, has evolved on the occasions of, the historic, national 200th Anniversary of the Revolution, and the ramifications of the global pandemic that has led to collective isolation and has prompted individual contemplation on the concept of patriotism.

Climbed on the medieval river Acheloos, rooted in the armatolikia of Thessaly, in the shadow casted by Kozikas mountain, following the stream of Pinios river to Agrafa, meeting the Vlach villages and the faded silhouettes of Friendly and Armatoloi, Christodoulos Chatzipetros, Eythymios Stournaras and Gregorios Liakatas, tracing blood, agony and iron in Syrrakos and Kalarrytes, overlooking Trikala and Pindos, chanting mountains, rivers, forests, fire, moons and fields, weaving moisture and sun on the grass below, collecting river pebbles and white flowers of remembrance, choosing release and abstraction, the narrative Οf the Plain articulates transverse coordinates, recalls ancient myths and historical events, invokes personal visual journeys, moments of prayer allegory and anguish, stories of love and darkness, hymns of victory and lamentations of death. Ultimately the narrative Of the Plain aims in human reconciliation with nature and the corpus of history.

According to the Kriaras Dictionary of the Medieval Greek Public Secretariat (1100-1669), the Dictionary of Common Modern Greek by the Manolis Triantaphyllides Foundation and the Etymological Dictionary of the Modern Greek Language by G. Babiniotis, the medieval term κάμπος, (semantic loan from the Latin campus, the Italian campo or the French champ), derives from the corresponding Hellenistic term that signifies the backdrop in Byzantine icons, but also the open space, the countryside, the flat area, the plain, the place around a rural house, the open sea, the camp, the battlefield, the stadium.

The art historian and curator of this exhibition, Iris Kritikou, invites thirteen acknowledged Greek artists who use different visual and semantic codes as well as distinct plastic media, to generate an independent organic field with literal and symbolic references to topographical coordinates and metaphorical nuances that embrace the wider area of ​​the Thessalian Plain.

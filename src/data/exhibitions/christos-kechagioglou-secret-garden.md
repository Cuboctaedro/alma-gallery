The secret garden is connected with the first, the mythical garden of Eden, the 
model of beauty and harmony, where man was placed, according to the great myth of 
creation, as a complete being in order to create and enjoy a happy life. Since then, 
through man's adventure in history, the garden has become a secret place within man. 
It's a condition that he misses, longs and yearns, although he has never experienced it. 
The idea of the “secret garden” is an artistic approach of this internal, indescribable 
place. It is in fact a transformed picture of reality and our world. Each piece of work is 
made as the transformation of what is familiar and it is a testimony and a sign of the 
existence of what is far away.

The transformation requires a different look, which, in painting, means first of all a 
different conception of light. What is attempted here, is a creation of a different lighting, 
which looks like the light as we know it, but which is something different in its essence. 
And of course, when we talk about light in painting, we refer to colour. Here in the 
garden, everything emits light; a light which becomes one with everything and vibrates 
everything. It is like a secret breeze which gives a freedom and an autonomy to all the 
things and elements of nature, which it turns into “ghosts”. The sea and the water turn 
into beings, but the buildings, the hills and the trees, the courts and the flowerbeds 
become independent motifs and turn into musical notes, into creatures of a fantastic 
journey in search of the unpredictable. Everything seems to lighten up in a weird, 
mystery scene.

The “Secret Garden” is the personal log of this exploration, without beginning 
and end; a recording of an internal history and geography, which bears the “ancient” joy 
for life. It is all an arbitrariness, a game. I paint and I feel that everything is arbitrary. But 
in the end, as a wise man says, the dreams and the daring almond trees that bloom in 
the middle of winter are arbitrary too.
